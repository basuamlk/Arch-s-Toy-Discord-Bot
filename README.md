Botsettings
--
The `./botsettings.example.json` file is meant to hide the discord token, your prefix of choice e.g.("-", "+", "="), and your API Key if you choose to use an API.
Your local file should just be named `'botsettings'`.

The configuration for your `./botsettings` folder is as follows:

>{"token": "Your Discord Token", 

>	"prefix": "=", 
	
>	"API_KEY": "Your API Key"}
***
The bot commands can be found in the **./cmds** folder.
